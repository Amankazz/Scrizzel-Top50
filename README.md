## Description

- For the base of your app we use Unity 3D which complements best with existing technologies of AR/VR. Unity 3D serves as a foundation to build the initial User-interface of the app and its controls using C#.

- For the backend, we mostly relied on Firebase, as it was easier to integrate with the flutter app, without any hassle to manage & create instances of our server.

- For storing the different types of data including 3d models, videos for image mapping, etc. we chose Cloud Firestore because of its robust features and ability to query & filter out data with ease.

- For image tracking, motion tracking, and plane tracking functionalities we used ArCore, ARFoundation and EasyAr SDK.
